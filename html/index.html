                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">The Brothers of Christ of Banneux, Inc. is
                        a religious
                        congregation founded by the Servant of God Msgr. Aloysius Schwartz, an American missionary
                        priest in
                        Seoul, Korea on May 10, 1981, to respond to the reality of poverty, suffering and deprivation of
                        the
                        poorest of the poor. The congregation supervises and maintains a program that provides shelter
                        and
                        training to the destitute and homeless elderly people and young adult. They render various forms
                        of
                        assistance and service that include direct evangelization and value formation, as well as
                        livelihood
                        trainings, self-help projects, recreational facilities and retreat activities. In Seoul, Korea
                        the
                        Brothers are taking care of 1,700 abandoned adults and elderly men who are physically and
                        mentally
                        challenged, homeless and alcoholic. The Brothers take proper care for those entrusted to their
                        care
                        by providing them free hospice, food, clothing, medical and health services. To broaden their
                        knowledge in the welfare and services, and to be able to provide quality services the Brothers
                        visited other welfare institutions for the homeless people located in the major cities in Korea
                        and
                        while others attended social welfare classes to obtain a social worker license. In the
                        Philippines,
                        seeing the Filipinos urgent need to alleviate the sufferings of the poor people, they decided to
                        set
                        up, supervise, operate and maintain a welfare program for the poorest of poor, elderly and young
                        adult, the OSY, physically and mentally challenged men by providing them with various forms of
                        voluntary assistance. To wit: Evangelization and value formation, livelihood programs, self-help
                        projects and recreational clientele coming from different places of the country. In almost two
                        years
                        of preparation for the operation of the residential care for the Out of School Youth, physically
                        and
                        mentally challenged men, they become busy visiting different kind of institutions to gather some
                        information and see the actual operation for the said clients. Seeing the needs of the society
                        for
                        the physically and mentally challenged men and the Out of School Youth, Brother Matthew Gu,
                        together
                        with the Filipino Brothers, established the Brothers of Christ of Banneux, Inc. (BCBI) in the
                        Philippines in order to serve these underprivileged people. The institution is a non-stock,
                        no-profit corporation that provides residential care for the poorest of the poor. It will be
                        maintained and supported by grants, donations, gifts and bequest from noble, selfless and
                        well-meaning persons and entities locally and internationally.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">The Servant of God, Venerable Aloysius
                        Schwarts was born
                        in
                        Washington
                        D.C. on September 18, 1930 to Louis Schwarts and Cedelia Bourassa. He grew up with the idea of
                        becoming a priest and with the passage of time, this idea became more specific he would become a
                        secular priest, work as missionary and his apostolate would be to the poor and the needy.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">In 1994, he entered in St. Charles
                        Seminary in Maryland.
                        He
                        finished his
                        B.A. Degree at Maryland
                        College and then he joined with Societe des Auxiliares des Mission (S.A.M.) and studied his
                        theology
                        at Louvine Catholic University in Belgium. He used to spend his vacation helping at the
                        rag-picker’s
                        camp. During his first visit to the shrine of the Virgin of The Poor, he felt inspired to
                        dedicate
                        his priesthood to the service of the poor, in fulfilment of the messages of our lady.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">He was ordained as a diocesan priest on
                        June 29, 1957 at
                        St.
                        Martin church, Washington D.C. and he
                        chose Korea as his first assignment although he was told that he might not be able to persevere
                        because of his somewhat delicate health. On December 8, 1957, he arrived at Korea. As a
                        consequence
                        of the Korean War, there were many widows, orphans, beggars and street children. Almost on-half
                        of
                        the adult population was without productive employment and reduced to selling rags and waste
                        paper,
                        begging and stealing as a last resort. He thanked God that after thirteen (13) years of
                        preparation;
                        finally he arrived at the place where he serve him through the poorest of the poor.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">He was full of zeal and worked so hard but
                        one day he
                        collapsed while saying mass and was diagnosed
                        to have hepatitis. His recovery was slow so he was advised to go back to the United States.
                        Without
                        money for his plane fare, he had to beg transportation from an American ship. While in the
                        United
                        States, he decided to make an effort to raise funds for the Korean poor. He made mission appeals

                        parish masses on Sundays. He didn’t mind the role of a beggar to be able to help the poor.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">In December 1961, he returned to Korea and
                        was assigned
                        as a
                        pastor of St. Joseph parish. He lived
                        like the poor people around the parish and continued helping the needy. He organized the Legion
                        of
                        Mary Ladies to assist in helping the poor. Later, through divine inspiration, he thought that in
                        order to serve the poor in the mind and heart of Jesus, they must be consecrated.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">He founded the religious Congregation of
                        the Sisters of
                        Mary
                        on August 15, 1964 in Amnamdong, Busan
                        and on May 10, 1981the Brothers of Christ. As a founder, he was an excellent model of genuine
                        service to the poor, which emanates from his unwavering faith and love of God present in the
                        Eucharist, in the scriptures, in others especially in the poor. And his zeal for God and for the
                        poor is also incarnated in the sisters and brothers hearts. They established Boystown and
                        Girlstown
                        to take care, educate and give a bright future to the orphans, street children from the very
                        poor
                        families from day one to their late teens. They also build hospitals and sanatoriums for very
                        indigent patients; hospices for the homeless and disabled elderly men, special children and
                        unwed
                        mothers. They are also involved in pro-life activities. His idea of helping the poor is not
                        mainly
                        material but above all spiritual. He always wanted to give the best service to the poor and to
                        offer
                        as many souls to God and to be Blessed Virgin.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">In 1983, he receive the Ramon Magsaysay
                        Award for his
                        excellent Charity works in Korea and for the
                        first time, he came in Manila. In 1985, seeing the urgent need of the poor specially the
                        children
                        and through the invitation of his Eminence Jaime Cardinal Sin and his total trust in God’s
                        providence, he started a new religious community in Archdiocese of Manila. Thus, expanding his
                        charity works in the Philippines. Construction of buildings and rounding of children from the
                        slum
                        and very poor areas were done and in few months they launch to work. In 1988, he received the
                        Mother
                        Teresa Award from the Manila Jaycees in Manila. In 1989, he was invited by his Eminence, Ricardo
                        Cardinal Vidal to establish his charity programs in Cebu. At present, they are taking care and
                        educating almost 12,000 boys and girls who are coming from different provinces of our country.

                        are being provided with food, clothing, shelter, high quality education with intensive
                        vocational

                        Youth,
                        Physically and Mentally challenged and Elderly.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle is-6 has-text-justified reveal fadeIn">In 1989, he was diagnosed to have terminal
                        illness.
                        Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which he
                        accepted with much joy, serenity and courage as a gift from God. He suffered excruciating due to
                        his
                        illness yet he smiledand cracked jokes to make others happy. In spite of his deteriorating
                        health,
                        he established Boystown and Girlstown in Mexico, which he called his “unfinished symphony”.</p>
